                Hello and welcome to Foodie Nation! If you are new to Foodie Nation, the one thing you should know about us is that we are obsessed with creating cooking recipes that you will love from scratch. There are two things we think about when deciding if a recipe is good enough to go on the site. First, does it work? Does the dish make us smile inside and out? Do we want to eat the whole batch by ourselves? Second, if the dish tastes great, is it worth the effort? Do we want to make it again (and again and again)? This is what we strive forâ€”recipes from all over the world that you can rely on to work every time and be worth your time, effort, and money to make! <a href="https://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/pan-seared-hanger-steak-with-brussels-sprouts-potatoes-and-lemon-herb-butter"> Recipies</a><br>

        The Flovers of Africa! Heavily influenced by imported spices, African recipes are known for their intense flavor. Many seasonings used in traditional African dishes can be made ahead in bulk and enjoyed for months at a time. Find your favorite combination in one of our African-inspired meals and bring the flavors of the region into your own home. 
        Beginning in the 17th century, slaves from Indonesia and India were brought to work the farms of Cape Town, South Africa, and became known as Cape Malays. As a result of their influence, Malay curry dishes are now enjoyed all over South Africa, combining sweet flavors such as dried fruit, ginger, and cinnamon with garlic and onions.<br><br>
